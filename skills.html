      <h1>My Skills</h1>
      <p>
        I have learned different skills in different types of work. I have been
        a housekeeper, and I moved up quickly to assistant manager. For a while
        I was a janitor at Hanes Brands warehouse's, eventually I became lead
        there and couldn't grow anymore. Now I am a software enginer, it's still
        new to me but I'm ambitious.

      <h2>Professional Cleaning w/ A Personal Touch</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked here for 5 years in this time I learned how to clean; all
        different floors, fridges, ovens, cabinets inside & out, walls, windows,
        bathrooms, baseboards, ceiling fans, anything & everything top to
        bottom. Thanks to this job I learned how to manages clients, staff,
        books, supplies, and prepare taxes. I also learned how to best help
        clients in their search.

      <h2>Sarver Cleaning Services</h2>
      <p>
        While working for this company I was in charge of keeping a whole
        warehouse clean with the help of 2 to 4 people. The turn over rate was
        high so we couldn't keep people.I worked here for a year as team lead.
        Sometimes I would have to go between 2 different warehouses to help out
        the other team. My hardest task was going between my bosses and the
        Hanes employees over us trying to serve everyone's needs. From there I
        would divide up the work between the people present at the time. My key
        takeaways this experence are; time management, having a good team is the
        best, hard work shows, effective communication, how to motivate,
        organization, decision making, confidence, and humility.
